# USCFR22ndCentury

**An open-source reprint of the United States Code of Federal Regulations (eCFR) structured for machine readability, version control, and civic transparency.**

## 📜 What This Is

This project captures the full text of the **eCFR (Electronic Code of Federal Regulations)** as it stood on **January 1st, 2025**, based on the publicly available Harvard Law Library copy.

Each section of law has been reformatted into a **logical folder hierarchy**, designed to be:
- Navigable by both **humans and machines**
- Compatible with **Git-based workflows**
- Annotatable, forkable, and diffable like software
- Structurally version-controlled, allowing for historic snapshots and community-led proposals

---

## 🧱 Versioning Philosophy

### 🔹 Version 1.0 — “The Virgin Codebase”
- A 1:1 textual reproduction of the 01/01/2025 eCFR
- No edits, no community changes, no redrafting
- Designed to serve as the canonical *base snapshot* of U.S. federal regulatory code in open-source structure

### 🔸 Future Versions — Divergent Lawforks
After v1.0, this repository may diverge from real federal law intentionally to:
- Prototype improvements in structure, clarity, or function
- Accept public proposals for legal reform
- Demonstrate what transparent, versioned, citizen-readable law *could* look like

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

> This repository is not an official or legal replacement for U.S. federal law.

This is a **reprint** of the 2025 eCFR for educational, archival, and experimental purposes. Only Version 1.0 (The Virgin Codebase) represents an untouched reproduction of real-world law.

Any future forks, changes, or rewrites are civic simulations or structural proposals and **must not be used for legal decisions or interpretations.**

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Today’s legal system is:
- Impossible to version
- Hard to audit
- Opaque to citizens
- Inaccessible to machines

By translating law into a Git-native, foldered, and hash-verifiable system, we aim to:
- Restore legal clarity
- Invite public collaboration
- Build the backbone for **open-source law in the 22nd century**

Because every American deserves to know what governs them—line by line, folder by folder, hash by hash.
